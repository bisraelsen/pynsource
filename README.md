I "forked" this repo so that I could get it working on Ubuntu. It wasn't working as a straight download for me. I found that if I switch `MULTI_TAB_GUI` from `True` to `False` in `pyNsourceGui.py` (line 32) then it runs. I am still using this and may change other stuff as necessary.

Read Readme.txt for the official readme.
